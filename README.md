Cryptocurrency Trading Dashboard

ðŸš€ Project Overview
After weeks of dedicated development and problem-solving, I built this dashboard to provide traders with real-time cryptocurrency data, portfolio tracking, and market trends. Designed to bridge the gap between complex APIs and user-friendly interfaces, this project reflects my passion for fintech, clean code, and responsive design.

âœ¨ Key Features
Real-time price tracking using CoinGecko API with dynamic charts.

Interactive UI with customizable watchlists and asset filtering.

Portfolio simulation to track virtual investments (demo mode).

Responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Challenges Overcome
Frontend
React.js (Hooks, Context API) for state management.

TailwindCSS for modular, responsive styling.

Recharts for interactive candlestick/line charts.

Deployment: Vercel (CI/CD integration).

Backend (if applicable)
Firebase for user authentication (stretch goal).

Node.js middleware for API rate-limiting (optional).

ðŸš§ Challenges & Solutions
API Rate Limits: Implemented client-side caching to reduce redundant calls.

UI Performance: Lazy-loaded charts and optimized re-renders with React.memo.

Data Accuracy: Sanitized API responses and added error fallbacks.

ðŸ“Œ Why This Project Stands Out
Professional-Grade UX: Prioritized intuitive navigation and accessibility (WCAG guidelines).

Extensible Architecture: Modular components for easy feature additions (e.g., WebSockets for live trades).

Learning Journey: Mastered async data flow, API integration, and responsive design from scratch.

ðŸ”œ Future Improvements
Advanced Features: Price alerts, multi-exchange support (Binance/Kraken APIs).

Auth & Databases: Firebase Auth + Firestore for user-specific portfolios.

Testing: Jest/React Testing Library for robust coverage.
